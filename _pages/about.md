> **Title**: Large Language Models for Automated Assembly of Molecular Mechanisms
> - **Date**: Saturday, 30th November 2024 (2:00-5:00 PM) & Sunday, 1st December 2024 (9:00 - 12:00 PM)
> - **Prerequisite Knowledge**:  Python programming and Machine Learning
> - **Learning Outcomes**: The participants will be able to learn to train LLMs on the biomedical corpus and use them for different biological applications like named entity recognition, relation extraction and summarization

# Outline of Workshop
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved our ability to process and analyze vast amounts of textual data. Scientific LLMs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various biomedical uses, such as analyzing textual knowledge, small molecules, macromolecular proteins, genomic sequences, and their combinations. As the repository of biomedical text records continues to grow, BioLLMs would empower life science and systems biology researchers with powerful tools to run in-depth analyses of extensive textual data. The tutorial will focus on understanding different aspects of LLMs, training LLMs on the biomedical corpus, and leveraging these BioLLMs for different biological applications, particularly, molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms can expand current databases and provide mechanistic interpretations for high-throughput experimental data. The tutorial will also emphasize educating the participants about the limitations and concerns of LLMs while offering a way to align the models to avoid misinformation and biases. All codes and resources showcased throughout this tutorial will be openly and freely accessible, accompanied by detailed documentation and comprehensive training materials. In addition to familiarizing themselves with each resource, participants will learn how to continue learning and apply it to research projects efficiently.
